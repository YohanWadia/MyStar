## Authentication Example
there are only 4 components here
- TextBox to enter name
- TextBox to enter password
- A Button
- a Text to display the result

---

## Remember
- myController1.text will give you what ever text is entered into the name TextBox
- myController2.text will give you what ever text is entered into the password TextBox
- change the name from "Yohan" to your name... and do the same with password. Change password to what ever you want.

---

## Test
- on the buttons onPressed event you have to have an if condition that accordingly gives you the result
- "Access Granted" if the name is equal to the text we get from myController.text and so is the password equal to the text we get from myController2.text
- "Access Denied" if even one of them are wrong
